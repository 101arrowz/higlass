View Configs
##########################

Genome Position Search Box
**************************

The genome position search box section a view config is specific to each view.
It is used to search for locations in the view. The full configuration has a
pointer to a chromSizes file and an autocomplete source which will provide
suggestions for gene names. The autocomplete source should point to a
`gene-annotations` file.

UIDs
****

UID stands for unique identifier. Every view and track in the higlass view
config has a UID. If it's not specified in the viewconfig it's randomly
generated by the client when the view is created.

initialXDomain and initialYDomain
*********************************

The fields contain the initial coordinates which are displayed when HiGlass
first loads the viewconfig. If the ``initialYDomain`` is not present, it is
set to equal the ``initialXDomain``. If that isn't present either, both are
assigned values of ``[0,1]]``.
