Coding Guidelines
=================

To ensure uniformity within the code base, we suggest the following
guidelines for style and documentation within the HiGlass ecosystem.

Spacing
-------

Code should be indented with 4 spaces. No tabs!




Docstrings
----------

All functions should be annotated with a docstring in the `numpy style
<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_.
