Coding Guidelines
=================

To ensure uniformity within the code base, we suggest the following
guidelines for style and documentation within the HiGlass ecosystem.

Spacing
-------

Code should be indented with 2 spaces. No tabs!

Docstrings
----------

All functions should be annotated with a docstring in the `JSDoc style <http://usejsdoc.org/>`_.
